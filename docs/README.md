## Xfers-Sobatku
Xfers formed a partnership with the credit union Koperasi Simpan Pinjam Sahabat Mitra Sejati (KSP SMS) and Bank Sahabat Sampoerna to launch an E-Savings product, Xfers-Sobatku, with the aim of providing a scalable and compliant solution to our merchants.
Each verified account on our platform is backed by an Xfers-Sobatku E-Savings account at KSP SMS, and you can be assured that your users’ money is secure. 

## Merchant Account
To start the integration process, you (the Merchant) will be required to create a Merchant Account with us. With this account, you will be able to register new users and start creating charges and making payouts to user accounts. 
Please send us an email to start the process.

## API vs SDK
Xfers provides two methods for merchants to integrate: API and SDK. To choose an approach that works best for you, consider the following factors:

|                            | SDK(Mobile and Web)  | API wrappers (Java) |    API   |
|----------------------------|:--------------------:|:-------------------:|:--------:|
