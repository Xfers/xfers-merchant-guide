# Electronic Signature

Our e-signature solution allows you to quickly provide document signature feature to your existing flow and comply with regulations. We work together with Privy, an approved DSP (Digital Signature Provider) by Kemenkominfo, to be able to produce legally-binding contracts needed between you and your users. With as simple as few API calls you will be able to register your user to Privy, upload your document and allow user to digitally sign that document. 

## KYC

Please note that all users must go through Xfers KYC process first before being able to be registered to Privy. KYC, otherwise known as “Know Your Customer”, is a process where we obtain information on individuals/entities to ensure adequate due diligence for Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter Terrorist Financing (CTF) efforts. This requires us to collect information on users’ identities and verifying the accuracy of the information provided to prevent misuse of our and our partners’ financial services.

## Merchant Account

This solution also requires you to set up a merchant account with us & Privy. To start this process, please contact us at sales@xfers.com with the subject line “Merchant Account Setup for E-signature”.
