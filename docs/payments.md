# PAYMENTS
Our payments solution allows your platform to start receiving and making payments to users upon the creation of a user account (either Guest or Verified). 

## Charge
### _Receiving payments_
To receive payment from a user, prompt the user to make a bank transfer of the specified amount and then simply create a charge with the same amount against that user.

## Refund
You can also easily refund a previously completed charge. This will return the funds equal to transaction amount to the user’s account and the associated fees if applicable. If you wish to send the funds directly to the user’s bank account, please add the user bank account and make a withdrawal on behalf of the user.
